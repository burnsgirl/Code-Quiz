For this project, I created a quiz that ask questions about JavaScript. I made a timer that runs for 60 seconds and if all the questions are not answered before 60 seconds, then the quiz is over. If the incorrect answer is selected, then there is a pop up that tells the player that they are incorrect. Once the quiz is over, it shows how many questions they answered correctly and ask the player to enter their initials to save to a high score list.
